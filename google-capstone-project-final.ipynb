While AI tutors are widely used in tech support, their role in education is still evolving. This paper presents early findings from an experimental setup where students interacted with a simple AI assistant during their online coursework.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe rise of online learning platforms has created both new opportunities and challenges in student engagement. AI chatbots, capable of providing instant feedback and support, might help address issues such as lack of motivation and low participation. However, limited empirical research has been done on their effectiveness in academic contexts.\n\nMethodology:\nWe conducted a preliminary trial with 30 undergraduate students enrolled in a blended learning course. A rule-based AI tutor was integrated into the LMS, answering content-related questions and providing encouragement during assignments.\n\nResults:\nInitial data shows an increase in the number of voluntary questions submitted by students. However, the impact on performance is inconclusive. Some students reported confusion due to the chatbot's limitations in answering complex questions.\n\n(Work in Progress – Conclusion and final analysis pending.

However, the study also found a tendency towards intuitive use and a lack of engagement with other language skills and subsystems.  The author concludes that language teachers should actively incorporate mobile technology into their teaching to promote more effective and independent language learning by showing the affordances of mobile technology and discussing them with students during language classes, selecting appropriate mobile apps and offering or designing tasks devoted to practicing a variety of language skills and subsystems suitable for the use of such devices.

The chapter argues that support should focus on the development of\ntwo vital learning skills, namely being able to self-regulate and to\ncollaborate effectively in the learning process. We base our argumentation on\nthe theoretical lenses of self-regulated learning (SRL) and collaborative\nlearning in the context of mobile situated learning that can take place in a\nvariety of settings. The chapter examines a sample of selected empirical\nstudies within the field of mobile-assisted language learning with a twofold\naim. Firstly, the studies are analyzed in order to understand the role of\nlearner self-regulation and collaboration while acquiring a new language beyond\nthe classroom. Secondly, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of any\nmechanisms provided to develop or support language learners' self-regulated and\ncollaborative lea ...\n🔗 Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12486v1\n\n📄 Title: Predicting Native Language from Gaze\nAuthors: Yevgeni Berzak, Chie Nakamura, Suzanne Flynn, Boris Katz\nSummary: A fundamental question in language learning concerns the role of a speaker's\nfirst language in second language acquisition. We present a novel methodology\nfor studying this question: analysis of eye-movement patterns in second\nlanguage reading of free-form text. Using this methodology, we demonstrate for\nthe first time that the native language of English learners can be predicted\nfrom their gaze fixations when reading English. We provide analysis of\nclassifier uncertainty and learned features, which indicates that differences\nin English reading are likely to be rooted in linguistic divergences across\nnative languages. The presented framework complements production studies and\noffers new ground for advancing research on multilingualism. ...\n🔗 Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07398v2\n\n📄 Title: A holographic mobile-based application for practicing pronunciation of\n  basic English vocabulary for Spanish speaking children\nAuthors: R. Cerezo, V. Calderon, C. Romero\nSummary: This paper describes a holographic mobile-based application designed to help\nSpanish-speaking children to practice the pronunciation of basic English\nvocabulary words. The mastery of vocabulary is a fundamental step when learning\na language but is often perceived as boring. Producing the correct\npronunciation is frequently regarded as the most difficult and complex skill\nfor new learners of English. In order to address these problems this research\ntakes advantage of the power of multi-channel stimuli (sound, image and\ninteraction) in a mobilebased hologram application in order to motivate\nstudents and improve their experience of practicing. We adapted the\nprize-winning HolograFX game and developed a new mobile application to help\npractice English pronunciation. A 3D holographic robot that acts as a virtual\nteacher interacts via voice with the children. To test the tool we carried out\nan experiment with 70 Spanish pre-school children divided into three classes,\nthe control group using t ...\n🔗 Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07897v1\n\n📄 Title: Prototype of a robotic system to assist the learning process of English\n  language with text-generation through DNN\nAuthors: Carlos Morales-Torres, Mario Campos-Soberanis, Diego Campos-Sobrino\nSummary: In the last ongoing years, there has been a significant ascending on the\nfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for performing multiple tasks\nincluding English Language Teaching (ELT). An effective strategy to favor the\nlearning process uses interactive devices to engage learners in their\nself-learning process. In this work, we present a working prototype of a\nhumanoid robotic system to assist English language self-learners through text\ngeneration using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks. The learners\ninteract with the system using a Graphic User Interface that generates text\naccording to the English level of the user. The experimentation was conducted\nusing English learners and the results were measured accordingly to\nInternational English Language Testing System (IELTS) rubric. Preliminary\nresults show an increment in the Grammatical Range of learners who interacted\nwith the system. ...\n🔗 Link: http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11142v1\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 4.3 Gemini Cross-Paper Analysis\nThis part summarizes the trends across top matched papers and compares them with the student's sample research paper ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# FEW-SHOT + STRUCTURED COMPARISON PROMPT\nfew_shot_examples = \"\"\"\nYou are an academic research assistant.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 Polish university students enrolled in English philology programs to explore their practices, perceptions, and the perceived benefits of mobile-assisted language learning (MALL).  Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the interview data revealed that smartphones are a frequently utilized tool, primarily for vocabulary acquisition, accessing online dictionaries, and leveraging language learning applications.  Learners reported convenience and accessibility as key advantages, often incorporating mobile devices into their leisure time for informal language learning. The findings suggest a positive correlation between mobile device use and perceived gains in English language proficiency.

It gives feedback and makes studying easier.\"\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n*   **Clarity:** The paragraph conveys a general idea, but lacks specific details and examples. It's unclear how AI helps teachers, how it gives feedback, and in what ways it makes studying easier. The claim that \"AI makes education better\" is a broad statement that needs further support and qualification. What aspect of education is better? For which students or teachers?\n\n*   **Grammar:** The grammar is technically correct and uses simple sentence structures. However, the simplicity contributes to the lack of depth and sophistication expected in academic writing. The repetition of \"It\" can also be slightly awkward and could be varied.\n\n*   **Academic tone:** The tone is too simplistic and informal for academic writing. Phrases like \"makes studying easier\" are vague and lack the precision required for a scholarly discussion. The claims are presented as facts without any supporting evidence or nuance. The overall tone is overly optimistic and glosses over potential drawbacks or limitations of AI in education.\n\n*   **Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n    1.  **Provide Specific Examples:** Instead of saying \"helping teachers and students,\" give concrete examples of how AI assists each group. For instance:\n        *   **Teachers:** \"AI-powered tools can automate grading of multiple-choice assessments, freeing up teacher time for personalized instruction and lesson planning.\"\n        *   **Students:** \"AI-driven tutoring systems can provide students with personalized learning pathways and adaptive feedback, addressing individual learning gaps more effectively.\"\n\n    2.  **Elaborate on \"Feedback\":** What kind of feedback does AI provide? How is it different from traditional feedback methods?\n        *   Example: \"AI algorithms can analyze student performance data to identify areas where students are struggling, providing teachers with actionable insights to tailor their instruction.\" Or, \"Students receive immediate, personalized feedback on their assignments, allowing them to identify and correct errors in real-time.\"\n\n    3.  **Define \"Makes Studying Easier\":** Be specific about how AI simplifies the learning process.\n        *   Example: \"AI-powered search engines and information retrieval systems provide students with rapid access to a vast array of resources, streamlining the research process and facilitating deeper understanding.\" Or, \"AI driven language learning apps provide personalized vocabulary lessons, thereby easing the process of learning a new language.\"\n\n    4.  **Add Nuance and Critical Thinking:** Academic writing should acknowledge both the benefits and potential drawbacks of a technology. Consider addressing limitations, ethical concerns, or potential challenges associated with AI in education.\n         * Example: \"While AI offers significant potential for enhancing education, it's crucial to address concerns regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for over-reliance on technology, which could diminish the importance of human interaction in the learning process.\"\n\n    5.  **Refine Sentence Structure and Vocabulary:** Aim for more complex sentence structures and a more sophisticated vocabulary. Avoid simplistic phrasing and choose words that convey precise meaning. For example, instead of \"makes education better,\" consider \"enhances educational outcomes\" or \"optimizes the learning experience.\"\n\n    6.  **Support Claims with Evidence:** Ideally, back up your claims with citations to relevant research or studies. For example, if you claim that AI improves student engagement, cite a study that supports this assertion.\n\nHere's an example of a revised paragraph incorporating these suggestions:\n\n\"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into educational settings, offering the potential to enhance educational outcomes for both teachers and students. For instructors, AI-powered tools can automate routine tasks such as grading multiple-choice assessments and providing personalized feedback to students, thereby freeing up time for more individualized instruction and curriculum development (Smith, 2023). Students can benefit from AI-driven tutoring systems that adapt to their individual learning styles and provide customized feedback, allowing them to identify and address knowledge gaps more effectively (Jones, 2022). However, it is crucial to acknowledge and mitigate potential challenges, such as ensuring data privacy and addressing algorithmic bias, to ensure equitable and ethical implementation of AI in education.\"\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🧾 Conclusion\n\nIn this project, we demonstrated a comprehensive and practical use of Generative AI to support academic research tasks.
