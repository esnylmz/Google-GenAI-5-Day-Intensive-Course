Academic research and writing a thesis is a demanding process. Researchers must not only discover, read, and digest a large number of papers but also understand their significance, compare them with others, and position their own work accordingly.

However, these tasks can be time-consuming and cognitively overwhelming â€” especially when papers are in PDF format, dense with jargon, or scattered across multiple platforms.

To address this pain point, our Capstone Project proposes a Generative AI-powered Research Assistant that leverages multiple GenAI capabilities to make research easier, smarter, and more interactive.
